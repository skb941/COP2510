# COP2510
Starting out with Python

This repository contains an archive of the code I compiled
using Python for my Programming Concepts course (COP 2510).

Please note that all programming exercises come straight from
the fourth edition of "Starting out with Python," so earlier or 
later editions may contain slight variations in presentation.
